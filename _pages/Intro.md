Hi, I am xxx, a passionate data science and software engineering researcher !

<!-- I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from [Queenâ€™s University](http://cs.queensu.ca/), Canada. My research interests include Data Mining, Empirical Software Engineering, and Mining Software Repositories (MSR, which applies Data Mining and Machine Learning techniques to solve Software Engineering problems). My Ph.D. thesis is about mining online game stores data, more specifically, mining data from Steam, the dominant online distribution platform for PC games, to improve user-perceived quality of games.

I received my education across China, Germany, and Canada, and have worked in different industries ranging from automotive, eCommerse, PC Gaming, to education. These experiences give me the ability to adapt to a multicultural environment and get along well with people from different backgrounds.

I lead the Software PErformance, Analysis, and Reliability (SPEAR) lab at Concordia University. My research focuses on improving the quality of large-scale software systems. I work on bug detection, software performance analysis, cloud-based systems, database-centric systems, software testing, and mining software repositories. My research tools were integrated into industrial practice for ensuring the quality of large-scale enterprise systems. -->

Research Interest
------
My general research area is Software Engineering. <!-- In particular, my research interest includes software engineering for ultra-large-scale systems, software log mining, empirical software engineering, mining software repositories and performance engineering.

In particular, my research aims to solve challenges such as:

- Can we quickly help developers debug production systems by utilizing rich software data?
- Can we provide suggestions on how to optimize the software system by analyzing user usage data?
- How to improve software quality assurances in DevOps environments by analyzing test results from continuous integration?
- Can we provide useful suggestions to developers by mining software development history? -->
