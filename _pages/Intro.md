Hi, I am Lizhi  Liao, a Ph.D student in Software Engineering at [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/). I am also a  passionate data science and software engineering researcher! I am currently under the supervision of [Dr. Weiyi Shang](https://users.encs.concordia.ca/~shang/) and work with the collegues in the Software Engineering and System Engineering Lab (SENSE). I received my Master's degree in Software Engineering from [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/), Montreal, Canada.  

I received my education across China and Canada, and have worked in different industries ranging from enterprise business solutions, to environmental management solutions. Before pursing my Ph.D's degree, I had been working as a software developer, writing programs for Java web applications. These experiences give me the ability to adapt to a multicultural environment and get along well with people from different backgrounds. Moreover, my research tools were integrated into industrial practices and running on a daily basis to ensure the quality of large-scale systems.

Research Interest
------
My general research area is Software Engineering. In particular, my research interest focus on mining software repositories, software log analysis and software performance engineering.

My research aims to solve challenges such as:

- How to help developes debug and verify software systems more easily by utilizing rich software history data?
- Can we detect performance regressions in ultra-large-scale systems?
- Can we provide developers with suggestions on the root causes of the performance regressions?



<!-- Can we quickly help developers debug production systems by utilizing rich software data?

How to improve logging practice in software development and operation?

What can we learn from the past software development (source code and bugs) and operation history (performance reports and field failures)?

How to scale software engineering research to cope with big data?

- How to improve software quality assurances in DevOps environments by analyzing test results from continuous integration?
- Can we provide useful suggestions to developers by mining software development history? -->
