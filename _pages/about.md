My general research area is Software Engineering. In particular, my research interest includes software engineering for ultra-large-scale systems, software log mining, empirical software engineering, mining software repositories and performance engineering.

In particular, my research aims to solve challenges such as:

- Can we quickly help developers debug production systems by utilizing rich software data?
- Can we provide suggestions on how to optimize the software system by analyzing user usage data?
- How to improve software quality assurances in DevOps environments by analyzing test results from continuous integration?
- Can we provide useful suggestions to developers by mining software development history?
